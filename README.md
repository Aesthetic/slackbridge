A OCF bridge between OCF IRC and Slack

Inspired by [slack-irc](https://github.com/ekmartin/slack-irc), which is an
awesome project to bridge between IRC and Slack. We wanted a more customized
version of that project that allowed for a bot per Slack user and mirrored
channels. We also like using Python for things instead of Node.js, so this
project was born out of those motivations.
